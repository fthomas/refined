### Changes

* TODO: Validate, Result
* Move `InferenceRule`, `Refined`, `RefType`, and `Predicate` from the
  `eu.timepit.refined` package into the `eu.timepit.refined.api` package.
* Rename `Predicate` to `Validate` and `InferenceRule` to `Inference`.
* Rename the `implicits` object to `auto` since the purpose of the
  implicit conversions there is to automatically convert base types to
  refined types. ([#61])
* Add a `copy` method to `Refined` to prevent the creation of a synthetic
  `copy` method that would subvert the private constructor. ([#57])
