### New features

* Add `Arbitrary` instance for `NonEmptyString`. ([#415][#415])
* Add `predicates` package which allows to import all predicates
  with a single `import eu.timepit.refined.predicates.all._`.
  ([#433][#433])
* Cross build the core module for Scala Native. ([#301][#301])

### Changes

* Change layout of the `types` package to create fewer instances and to
  support "auto import" in IntelliJ. ([#416][#416], [#431][#431]) 
* Move `Validate` instances into the companions of their respective
  predicate instead of a prefix because in a future Scala version
  prefixes might not be searched for implicits, see
  [scala-dev/#446][scala-dev/#446]. ([#438][#438])

### Bug fixes

### Deprecations and removals

* Deprecate `Subtype` and `Supertype` predicates because they lack
  practical relevance. ([#432][#432])
* Deprecate `ConstructorNames` and `FieldNames` predicates because they
  operate on types instead of values (i.e. the result of a validation
  only depends on the type of a value) and the library focuses on
  refining values.
* Remove deprecated `util.time` module which has been replaced by
  the `types.time` module. ([#425][#425])
* Remove deprecated `Refined#get` method which has been replaced by
  `Refined#value`. ([#426][#426])

### Updates

* Update `refined-scalaz` to Scalaz 7.2.19. ([#434][#434])
