### New features

* Add new `Trimmed` predicate and use it to implement `TrimmedString`.
  This also adds `TrimmedString.trim` to create a `TrimmedString` from
  an arbitrary `String` and an `Arbitrary` instance for `TrimmedString`.
  ([#504][#504] by [@ceedubs][@ceedubs])
* Add `Arbitrary` instances for `NonEmpty` `List`s and `Vector`s.
  ([#486][#486] by [@fthomas][@fthomas])
* New predicates `ValidByte`, `ValidShort`, and `ValidFloat` that check
  if a `String` is a parsable `Byte`, `Short`, or `Float`.
