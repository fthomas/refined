### Changes

* Add the `refined-pureconfig` subproject which adds support for
  refined types to [PureConfig](https://github.com/melrief/pureconfig).
  Thanks to [Viktor Lövgren](https://github.com/vlovgr)! ([#233])
* Deprecate `Refined#get` in favor of `Refined#value` to avoid
  confusion with `Option#get` which is an unsafe operation while
  `Refined#get` was always safe. ([#220])
* Remove deprecated `RefinePartiallyApplied.force` which has been
  renamed to `unsafeFrom` in version 0.5.0. ([#225])

### Updates

* Update to Scala 2.12.1. ([#226])
* Update to Scala.js 0.6.14. ([#232])
* Update `refined-scalaz` to Scalaz 7.2.8. ([#223])
