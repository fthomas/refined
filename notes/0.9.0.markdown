### New features

* Type class derivation for refined types via `Contravariant` or
  `MonadError` instances of the respective type class. This allows,
  for example, to derive encoders and decoders for refined types
  via encoders and decoders of their base types.
  ([#447][#447] by [@fommil][@fommil] for Scalaz and
  [#449][#449] by [@fthomas][@fthomas] for Cats)
* Add `Arbitrary` instances for `List`, `Vector`, and `String` refined
  with any `Size[P]`. ([#455][#455], [#471][#471]
  by [@matthedude][@matthedude] and [@fthomas][@fthomas])
* Add `Arbitrary` instance for `NonEmptyString`. ([#415][#415])
* Add `predicates` package which allows to import all predicates
  with a single `import eu.timepit.refined.predicates.all._`.
  ([#433][#433])
* Cross build the `refined`, `refined-scalaz`, and `refined-shapeless`
  modules for Scala Native. ([#301][#301], [#478][#478])
* Add inference rules for `Greater[N] ==> GreaterEqual[N]` and
  `Less[N] ==> LessEqual[N]`. ([#452][#452] by [@zainab-ali][@zainab-ali])
* Add new `refined-shapeless` module that provides `Typeable` instances
  for refined types. ([#456][#456] by [@umbreak][@umbreak])
* Add new `refined-scopt` module for integration of refined types
  with [scopt](https://github.com/scopt/scopt).
  ([#457][#457] by [@nrinaudo][@nrinaudo])
* Add `HexString`, `MD5`, `SHA1`, `SHA224`, `SHA256`, `SHA384`,
  and `SHA512` types. ([#453][#453] by [@NeQuissimus][@NeQuissimus])
* Add `FiniteString[N]` type for `String`s with length less than or
  equal to `N`. ([#437][#437], [#479][#479])

### Changes

* Change layout of the `types` package to create fewer instances and to
  support "auto import" in IntelliJ. ([#416][#416], [#431][#431])
* Move `Validate` instances into the companions of their respective
  predicate instead of a prefix because in a future Scala version
  prefixes might not be searched for implicits, see
  [scala-dev/#446][scala-dev/#446]. ([#438][#438])
* Update documentation to solve "exception during macro expansion" errors.
  ([#451][#451] by [@umbreak][@umbreak])

### Deprecations and removals

* Deprecate `Subtype` and `Supertype` predicates because they lack
  practical relevance. ([#432][#432])
* Deprecate `ConstructorNames` and `FieldNames` predicates because they
  operate on types instead of values (i.e. the result of a validation
  only depends on the type of a value) and the library focuses on
  refining values. ([#435][#435])
* Remove deprecated `util.time` module which has been replaced by
  the `types.time` module. ([#425][#425])
* Remove deprecated `Refined#get` method which has been replaced by
  `Refined#value`. ([#426][#426])
* Deprecate `scalacheck.util.Adjacent` in favor of `internal.Adjacent`
  in the core module. ([#475][#475])
* Deprecate `scalacheck.util.Bounded` in favor of `api.{Min, Max}`
  in the core module. ([#482][#482])

### Updates and build

* Update `refined-cats` to Cats 1.1.0. ([#467][#467])
* Update `refined-scalaz` to Scalaz 7.2.21. ([#434][#434], [#468][#468]
  by [@fthomas][@fthomas] and [@fommil][@fommil])
* Update to the latest `travis_setup.sh` for Scala Native.
