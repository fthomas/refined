### New features

* Add `Arbitrary` instance for `NonEmptyString`. ([#415][#415])
* Add `predicates` package which allows to import all predicates
  with a single `import eu.timepit.refined.predicates.all._`.
  ([#433][#433])

### Changes

* Change layout of the `types` package to create fewer instances and to
  support "auto import" in IntelliJ. ([#416][#416], [#431][#431])
* Deprecate `Subtype` and `Supertype` predicates because they lack
  practical relevance. ([#432][#432])
* Remove deprecated `util.time` module which has been replaced by
  the `types.time` module. ([#425][#425])
* Remove deprecated `Refined#get` method which has been replaced by
  `Refined#value`. ([#426][#426])

### Bug fixes

### Updates

* Update `refined-scalaz` to Scalaz 7.2.19. ([#434][#434])
